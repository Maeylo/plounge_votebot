I am your friendly neighbourhood lynch vote bot for {{args.name_pretty}}!

Please respond to this comment with \*\***vote: player**\*\* in order to cast your vote for their lynch!
You can also \*\***vote: no lynch**\*\* if you would prefer there to be no lynch today.

%if args.hammers:
Voting ends when a majority is reached. You cannot change your vote after this occurs.
%else:
Voting ends at the end of the day (when a mod triggers it). You cannot change your vote after this occurs.
%end

If you wish to retract your vote, you may \~\~~~strikethough~~\~\~ your old vote.

%if post:
%votes = state['votes'][post.id]['current_votes']
%import collections
%vote_counts = collections.Counter([v['lynch'] for v in votes.values()])
| Player | Votes |
|:-------|------:|
%for target, count in vote_counts.most_common():
|{{fix_case(target)}}|{{count}}|
%end
%
%vote_threshold = state['vote_threshold']
%if not isinstance(vote_threshold, int):
%    vote_threshold = len(state['alive_players']) / 2 + 1
%end

%#{{vote_threshold}} votes are needed for a lynch.

%if state['votes_ended_at']:
Voting ended at {{time(state['votes_ended_at'])}}
%end
