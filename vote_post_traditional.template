I am your friendly neighbourhood lynch vote bot!

Please respond to this comment with \*\***vote: player**\*\* in order to cast your vote for their lynch!
You can also \*\***vote: no lynch**\*\* if you would prefer there to be no lynch today.

Voting ends when a majority is reached. You cannot change your vote after this occurs.

If you wish to retract your vote, you may \~\~~~strikethough~~\~\~ your old vote.

%if post:
%votes = state['votes'][post.id]['current_votes']

%vote_counts = collections.Counter([v['lynch'] for v in votes.values()])
%for target, count in sorted(vote_counts.items(), key = lambda x: x[1]):
| Player | Votes |
|:-------|------:|
|{{fix_case(target)}}|{{count}}|
%end

%if state['votes_ended_at']:
Voting ended at {{time(state['votes_ended_at'])}}
